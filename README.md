## Time Cheat Sheet (Big O)
          - Arrays: 
                    - Accessing index:  O(1)
                    - Inserting, Deleting, Modifying:  O(n)
          - Linked List:
                    - Accessing index, Inserting, Deleting:  O(n)
          - For Loop:  Each 'For' costs O(n)

## Notes:
          - Data Structures
                    - Linear Data Structure:  (Data is listed sequentially)
                              - Array
                              - Linked List
                              - Stack
                              - Queue
                    - Recursive Data Structure:
                              - Tree
                              - Graph

          - Trees
                    - Root:  Start of the tree
                    - Node:  Index of the tree
                    - Parent:  A node that has follow-on connections (children)
                    - Children:  A node that has a predecesor (parent)
                    - Sibling:  Nodes that share the same parent
                    - Leaf:  A node that has no children
                    - Depth:  Length of the path from the root to node 'x' (# of edges)
                    - Height:  # of edges in the longest path from node 'x' to a leaf

          - Data Structures Selection Criteria
                    - What needs to be stored?
                    - Cost of operations?
                    - Memory usage?
                    - Ease of Implementation?
